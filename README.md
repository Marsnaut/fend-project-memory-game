# Project Overview

This project is an implementation of a Memory Game. It uses JavaScript, jQuery and HTML/CSS styling. It is an interactive game where you complete 8 pairs of matches to win the game.

## Steps to successfully run this application

Nothing special is needed to run this application. However, I suggest doing `npm install jquery` if you do not have it installed globally. There is no `package.json` attached.

Open the `index.html` file in any browser to load the file.
